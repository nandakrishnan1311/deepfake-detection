## Please note that
The Deepfake Detection System, utilizing Vision Transformer (ViT) and Wav2Vec2 Transformer models with a Late Fusion strategy, achieves an impressive 86.35% accuracy, surpassing traditional forensic and CNN-based approaches by effectively identifying subtle visual and auditory inconsistencies in AI-generated media. Despite challenges, the system addresses critical limitations to ensure reliability and practicality. Binary classification shortcomings, where realistic deepfakes blur the line between real and fake, leading to false positives and negatives, were mitigated by implementing confidence-based classification, providing nuanced outputs like “likely fake” or “high-confidence fake” to enhance decision-making. High computational demands, driven by the resource-intensive ViT and Wav2Vec2 models and large datasets, posed issues on local machines but were overcome using Google Colab’s free GPUs, cloud-based TPUs, and model quantization to optimize memory and processing times. Additionally, generalization to evolving real-world deepfakes, generated by advanced techniques like GANs and Stable Diffusion, was challenging due to occasional misclassification of high-quality fakes; this was addressed through continuous model retraining with new datasets, adversarial training, and hybrid detection incorporating video, audio, and temporal analysis. The Flask-based web application, secured with HTTPS, JWT authentication, and bcrypt hashing, delivers real-time, user-friendly deepfake verification, making it accessible to journalists, cybersecurity experts, and the public. By overcoming these technical hurdles, the system bridges cutting-edge AI research with practical applications, significantly contributing to the fight against digital misinformation and reinforcing trust in media authenticity.
